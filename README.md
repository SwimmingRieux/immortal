# Immortal

The Immortal is a [Nostr](https://nostr.com) relay implementation written in Golang.

Immortal aimed and designed to be **scalable**, **high-performance**, and **configurable**. Basically it's a good choice for paid relays or big community relays and not a good choice as a personal relay.
